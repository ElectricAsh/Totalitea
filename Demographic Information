52~% Tea
35% Coffee
11% Neither
3% Dont know

Above results show that overall tea is preferred to coffee. So we would highlight tea slightly more

Age bar chart-----

18-24 year olds dont have preference. Therefore target this age group with advertising for more expensive items
25-39 year olds equal across all things. 
40+ prefer tea ( could technically take age and change what is advertised based on that)

Social class doesnt affect preference on items therefore show half of premimum/half of normal etc.

Highlight iced versions of tea/coffee during summer time
