Error Log

Class not found exception - Error due to ojdbc7 file. The file was in eclipse, Tomcat and not in the buildpath.
	Having 2 ojdbc7 files is seen as equivalent as having none in terms of the program

Issue where could not get login feature to work 

Process of checking:

- Creating another string and printing out (select * from users where user = username and password = pwd)
- Didnt work through Java but did work when running the query through cmd
- Added in a sysout of "output is" it found steve and horse from user input but still didnt print information from table
- Decided to run "select count(*) as cnd" -> "results.getint("cnd") -> result.next()
	- Came back as 0 therefore java did not find any rows matching the information we inputted
- Checked database where none of our queries were committed therefore java was only looking at an empty table
- Added in commits and solved the problem
