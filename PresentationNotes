What to take from previous Cohort presentations:

- Screenshot a few slides of what their presentation actually looks like and put in 
  a word document. 
		- Used to judge how we want slides to look. e.g colour scheme
		
- Screenshot any ERD, Component or Class diagrams they have to make sure ours are right
	- Write out how synopsis of how they describe diagrams. e.g if they do it during client section or if during the talk about java 
	  A few sentences of what they actually say
	
- Approx how long is the website demo. 
	- Are they explaining design choices?
	- Are they just showing and pointing out the features on there?

	- Approx how long, how many graphs. 
	- Do they mention how it changed their design and show this change?
	- Do they mention the clients previous business logic?
	
- How are they demonstrating the code and good practices.
	- are they showing screenshots of code or going through their eclipse?
